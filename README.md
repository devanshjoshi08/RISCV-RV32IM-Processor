# RISC-V RV32IM Pipelined Processor

A 6-stage pipelined RISC-V processor implementing the RV32IM instruction set in SystemVerilog, deployed on a Digilent Basys 3 FPGA (Xilinx Artix-7 XC7A35T) with clean timing closure at **100 MHz**.

The design supports all 48 RV32IM instructions with hardware multiply/divide, M-mode privileged architecture (CSR access, trap handling, MRET), a gshare branch predictor with branch target buffer and return address stack, a direct-mapped instruction cache, 3-source data forwarding across the 6-stage pipeline, and 64-bit hardware performance counters for cycle-accurate IPC measurement. The processor runs bare-metal C programs compiled with a standard RISC-V GCC toolchain, communicating over UART at 115200 baud with LED output on the FPGA.

The architecture evolved from a conventional 5-stage pipeline that failed to meet timing after the addition of the M extension and privileged features. Timing analysis revealed a 19-level combinational critical path through the execute stage at 15.5 ns, capping the design at 64 MHz. Splitting the execute stage into separate forwarding and computation stages reduced the critical path to 7 logic levels at 9.87 ns, achieving a 56% frequency improvement and full timing closure at the 100 MHz target. The design rationale, timing data, and architectural tradeoffs are documented in detail below.

Functionally validated through a 24-point comprehensive test suite, 37-test riscv-tests ISA compliance suite, and hardware deployment running a Fibonacci demo with verified UART output and LED display.

## Motivation: From 5-Stage to 6-Stage

The standard Patterson & Hennessy 5-stage pipeline (IF/ID/EX/MEM/WB) served as the starting point for this design. With the base RV32I instruction set alone, the 5-stage implementation met timing at approximately 91 MHz on the target Artix-7 fabric, with a worst negative slack of -0.938 ns at the 100 MHz constraint.

The problem emerged when extending the processor to support the M extension (hardware multiply/divide), M-mode privileged CSRs, trap handling, and a gshare branch predictor. These features converge in the execute stage: the forwarding unit must compare source register addresses against three pipeline stages, select through a multi-level mux, then feed the result into the ALU carry chain, branch comparator, CSR read path, and result selection mux, all within a single clock cycle. After place-and-route, the critical path through this logic measured **15.5 ns across 19 logic levels**, from the forwarding address comparison in the ID/EX register through the ALU output to the EX/MEM register. Timing failed with a WNS of **-5.539 ns**, limiting the design to approximately **64 MHz**.

At 64 MHz with a 100 MHz constraint, 36% of each clock period is wasted slack where the combinational logic has already settled but the clock edge hasn't arrived. More critically, the design cannot meet its own timing specification, meaning hold-time violations could cause functional failures on hardware under certain PVT (process/voltage/temperature) conditions.

The solution was to split the execute stage into two pipeline stages, following the approach used in production cores like ARM Cortex-M4 and RISC-V Ibex when targeting higher clock frequencies:

- **EX1 (Forwarding + Operand Select)**: performs the 3-source forwarding comparison and mux, selects ALU operands (rs1/PC for AUIPC, rs2/immediate for I-type), and prepares CSR write data. The output is registered into the EX1/EX2 pipeline register.
- **EX2 (ALU + Branch + CSR + MDU)**: takes the registered operands and feeds them directly into the ALU, branch unit, multiply/divide unit, and CSR unit with no preceding combinational logic.

This partitioning reduces the longest combinational path from 19 logic levels to 7, bringing the critical path delay under the 10 ns budget with 0.135 ns of positive slack. The architectural tradeoff is a deeper pipeline: branch mispredictions now incur a 3-cycle penalty (flushing IF, ID, and EX1) compared to 2 cycles in the 5-stage design. The gshare predictor with BTB and return address stack mitigates this by predicting both direction and target in the fetch stage, keeping the effective misprediction rate low enough that the IPC impact is minimal relative to the 56% frequency improvement.

```

### IF (Instruction Fetch)

The PC feeds a 64-line direct-mapped instruction cache. Hits return combinationally; misses pull from the backing ROM and fill the line in one cycle. A three-component branch predictor runs in parallel:

- **Gshare PHT** (64 entries, 2-bit saturating counters) predicts direction by indexing with PC[7:2] XOR a 6-bit global history register
- **BTB** (32 entries, direct-mapped) supplies the predicted target address, storing tag + target + entry type (branch/JAL/call/return)
- **RAS** (4-entry circular stack) predicts return targets for JALR instructions

If the BTB hits and the PHT says taken (or the entry is a JAL/call/return), the PC redirects speculatively to the predicted target. Mispredictions are detected in EX2 and cause a 3-cycle flush.

### ID (Instruction Decode)

The instruction is decoded into control signals for all RV32IM + SYSTEM instructions. The immediate generator reassembles sign-extended immediates from all 5 RISC-V formats (I/S/B/U/J). The register file (32x32 with write-through bypass from WB) reads both source operands.

Call/return heuristics detect JAL/JALR instructions targeting link registers (x1 or x5) and push the return address onto the RAS.

### EX1 (Forwarding + Operand Select)

Three forwarding sources resolve RAW data hazards without stalling:

| Source | Distance | Data |
|--------|----------|------|
| EX2 | 1 instruction ahead | ALU result, LUI immediate, or CSR read (combinational, gated by MDU valid) |
| MEM | 2 instructions ahead | ALU result, CSR data, PC+4, or load data from dmem |
| WB | 3 instructions ahead | Final write-back value |

Priority: EX2 > MEM > WB (most recent result wins). Loads and in-progress MDU operations in EX2 are excluded from forwarding; the hazard unit stalls instead.

The forwarding mux also has a fresh register file read path with WB bypass. This handles the edge case where an instruction is stalled in EX1 for many cycles (during a multi-cycle divide) and the pipelined register file value goes stale because the source register was written by an instruction that has since left WB. Without this path, the processor would silently read an outdated value after the stall releases. This took a while to find.

After forwarding, the ALU input muxes select between the forwarded rs1/PC (for AUIPC) and forwarded rs2/immediate (for I-type). The CSR write data is also prepared here (either the forwarded rs1 value or the zero-extended zimm field for immediate CSR variants).

### EX2 (Execute)

The registered operands from EX1 feed directly into the ALU and branch unit with no preceding combinational logic, keeping this stage fast.

**ALU**: 10 operations (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, SLT, SLTU, SLL, SRL, SRA).

**MDU** (Multiply/Divide Unit): 2-cycle pipelined multiplier for MUL/MULH/MULHSU/MULHU (operands registered on cycle 1, multiplication on cycle 2, infers 12 DSP48 blocks on Artix-7). 32-cycle iterative restoring divider for DIV/DIVU/REM/REMU with pipeline stall. Handles all edge cases per the RISC-V spec: division by zero returns quotient = -1 and remainder = dividend; signed overflow (MIN_INT / -1) returns MIN_INT with remainder 0.

**Branch unit**: evaluates all 6 branch conditions (BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU). Branch target = PC + immediate. JALR target = (rs1 + immediate) & ~1. Misprediction detection compares actual outcome against the prediction carried through the pipeline.

**CSR unit**: atomic read-modify-write for all 6 CSR instructions. Holds the M-mode register file (mstatus, mie, mtvec, mscratch, mepc, mcause, mtval, mip) plus 64-bit performance counters (mcycle, minstret, and two custom HPM counters for branch statistics).

**Trap detection**: catches illegal instructions, ECALL, and EBREAK. On a trap: flush the pipeline (IF, ID, EX1), save PC to mepc, write cause to mcause, disable interrupts (MIE → MPIE), redirect PC to mtvec. MRET reverses the process: restore MIE from MPIE, redirect PC to mepc.

### MEM (Memory Access)

The MMIO controller routes accesses by address:

| Address Range | Peripheral |
|---------------|------------|
| `0x00000000` - `0x00000FFF` | 4 KB data RAM (byte/half/word addressable with sign extension) |
| `0x10000000` | 16-bit LED output |
| `0x10000004` | 16-bit switch input |
| `0x10000008` | UART TX data (write a byte to transmit) |
| `0x1000000C` | UART TX busy flag |

The UART runs at 115200 baud, 8N1, implemented as a shift-register transmitter with a busy-wait interface.

### WB (Write Back)

The write-back mux selects the final result for the register file:

| Condition | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| JAL / JALR | PC + 4 (return address) |
| Load | Data memory read |
| CSR instruction | CSR read value |
| Everything else | ALU result (includes LUI) |

The register file write port includes a write-through bypass: if WB writes a register in the same cycle that ID reads it, the new value is forwarded directly, avoiding a stale read.

## Hazard Handling

The hazard unit manages three types of pipeline hazards:

**Load-use**: if the instruction in EX2 is a load and the instruction in EX1 reads the same register, the data won't be available until after the memory read. The hazard unit stalls PC, IF/ID, and ID/EX1 for one cycle and flushes EX1/EX2, inserting a bubble. On the next cycle, the load data is available from MEM for forwarding.

**MDU stall**: multiply takes 2 cycles, divide takes up to 33 cycles. While the MDU is computing, the entire pipeline from EX2 back is stalled (PC, IF/ID, ID/EX1, EX1/EX2 all hold). EX2/MEM receives bubbles (suppressed control signals) to prevent intermediate results from propagating. When the MDU signals valid, the stall releases and the result is forwarded.

**Control hazards**: branch mispredictions, JAL, JALR, traps, and MRET all flush the three stages behind EX2 (IF, ID, EX1). The gshare predictor reduces misprediction frequency; the BTB eliminates the target computation penalty for correctly-predicted branches.

## M Extension

All 8 RV32M instructions are implemented in hardware:

| Instruction | Latency | Implementation |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| MUL | 2 cycles | Pipelined: register operands on cycle 1, DSP48 multiply on cycle 2 |
| MULH | 2 cycles | Signed x signed, upper 32 bits of 64-bit product |
| MULHSU | 2 cycles | Signed x unsigned, upper 32 bits |
| MULHU | 2 cycles | Unsigned x unsigned, upper 32 bits |
| DIV | 33 cycles | Iterative restoring divider, signed, pipeline stalls |
| DIVU | 33 cycles | Iterative restoring divider, unsigned |
| REM | 33 cycles | Remainder from signed division |
| REMU | 33 cycles | Remainder from unsigned division |

The multiplier is pipelined to enable clean DSP48 inference on Artix-7. Each DSP48E1 block handles a 25x18 signed multiply natively; a full 32x32 → 64-bit multiply is decomposed across multiple blocks. The divider uses a standard restoring algorithm: shift the dividend left one bit per cycle, trial-subtract the divisor, and build up the quotient bit by bit. Signed division takes absolute values of both operands, divides unsigned, then negates the result based on the original signs.

Division by zero is handled per the RISC-V spec without trapping: quotient = all ones (-1 signed), remainder = the dividend. Signed overflow (0x80000000 / -1) returns 0x80000000 with remainder 0.

## Privileged Architecture

The processor implements M-mode (machine mode) from the RISC-V Privileged Specification:

| CSR | Address | Function |
|-----|---------|----------|
| mstatus | 0x300 | Global interrupt enable (MIE), previous interrupt enable (MPIE) |
| mie | 0x304 | Per-source interrupt enable mask |
| mtvec | 0x305 | Trap vector base address |
| mscratch | 0x340 | Scratch register for trap handler use |
| mepc | 0x341 | PC of the instruction that caused the trap |
| mcause | 0x342 | Trap cause code |
| mtval | 0x343 | Additional trap information (faulting instruction/address) |
| mip | 0x344 | Pending interrupts |

All 6 CSR instructions are supported: CSRRW, CSRRS, CSRRC (register operand) and CSRRWI, CSRRSI, CSRRCI (5-bit zero-extended immediate). ECALL, EBREAK, and MRET are fully implemented with correct pipeline flushing and state save/restore.

## Performance Counters

Four 64-bit hardware counters tick automatically and are readable via CSR instructions:

| Counter | CSR Address | What it counts |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| mcycle | 0xB00 / 0xB80 | Clock cycles since reset |
| minstret | 0xB02 / 0xB82 | Instructions retired (committed at MEM stage) |
| mhpmcounter3 | 0xB03 / 0xB83 | Branch mispredictions |
| mhpmcounter4 | 0xB04 / 0xB84 | Total branches executed |

These enable IPC measurement and predictor tuning from software:

```c
unsigned int c0, c1, i0, i1;
asm volatile("csrr %0, mcycle" : "=r"(c0));
asm volatile("csrr %0, minstret" : "=r"(i0));
// ... workload ...
asm volatile("csrr %0, mcycle" : "=r"(c1));
asm volatile("csrr %0, minstret" : "=r"(i1));
// IPC = (i1 - i0) / (c1 - c0)
```

## Verification

The processor is tested at four levels, from unit to system:

| Level | Testbench | What it covers | Result |
|-------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| 1 | `rv32i_tb.sv` | Single-cycle reference: every instruction in isolation | PASS |
| 2 | `rv32i_pipeline_tb.sv` | Pipeline correctness: sum 1-to-10, exercises forwarding, load-use stalls, branch misprediction. Expected: x1 = x5 = 55, mem[0] = 55 | PASS |
| 3 | `rv32i_comprehensive_tb.sv` | 24-point test covering M-ext (all 8 ops + edge cases), all 6 CSR instructions, trap handling (ecall → handler → mret → resume), performance counters, and pipeline hazard forwarding from mul to dependent add. Automated PASS/FAIL with summary | **24/24 PASS** |
| 4 | `rv32i_riscv_tests_tb.sv` | Official riscv-tests compliance suite: 37 rv32ui-p-* tests covering every RV32I instruction with corner cases | PASS |

The comprehensive test (level 3) is designed to catch the subtle bugs that simple tests miss:

- **Divide-by-zero and signed overflow**: verifies the MDU returns spec-compliant results for 7/0, MIN_INT/-1
- **CSR read-modify-write atomicity**: writes 0xDEADBEEF to mscratch, reads it back, then chains CSRRS → CSRRC → CSRRWI → CSRRSI → CSRRCI, verifying each intermediate value
- **Trap round-trip**: sets mtvec, triggers ecall, handler reads mcause (expects 11), advances mepc past the ecall, executes mret, verifies execution resumes at the correct PC
- **Forwarding under stall**: multiply followed by an immediately dependent add, verifying EX2 → EX1 forwarding produces the correct result even with MDU pipeline latency

A GitHub Actions CI workflow runs the pipeline and comprehensive testbenches on every push using Icarus Verilog.

## FPGA Demo

The instruction ROM ships with a precompiled Fibonacci program. When deployed on the Basys 3:

- The serial terminal (115200 baud) prints F(0) through F(19) as each value is computed
- The LEDs show the lower 16 bits of the current Fibonacci number
- After completion, LEDs hold F(19) = 4181 = 0x1055 (LEDs 0, 2, 4, 6, 12 lit)
- Pressing the center button resets the processor and reruns the program

A separate `perf_report.c` program (compilable with the RISC-V toolchain) runs the same Fibonacci workload and then prints cycle count, instruction count, IPC, total branches, mispredictions, and mispredict rate over UART.
